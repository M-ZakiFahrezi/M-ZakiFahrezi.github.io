**Navigation** is how users move from one page or section to another within a website.

Good navigation helps users find information quickly and efficiently.

### 📌 Simple Navigation Example

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
